# Trinity

Trinity is an audio player with Discord RPC and YouTube playback support, designed specifically for **myself**.  
However I might add other features if I have the energy to do so.

# Features
* OS: Windows 10+
* Play YouTube audio (Streams aren't supported for now)
* Supported codec: Opus only

# Features that I might add
* Linux support (Change UI Framework to Uno or Avalonia?)
* Other audio codecs
* Video playback support
* YouTube streams support
* Custom activity ("Listening to Trinity", breaks ToS)
